# ECG-GAN
Synthesizing ECG Signals Using GAN. This project is the base for the paper "Improving Cloud-based ECG Detection and Classification using GAN" published in the Journal "Fusion:
Practice and Applications"(Under American Scientific Publishing Group) Volume 2, Issue 2 ISSN (Online) : 2692- 4048

There is a shortage of medical data either due to confidentiality or rarity of the disease. This scarcity of data leads to inefficient Deep Learning models which may be able to detect such problems at early stages. To deal with that, this project synthesizes ECG signals using GAN, specifically to compensate for the class imabalance present in the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database.
